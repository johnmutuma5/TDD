Test Driven Development: A demo

Usage:
  - Clone repo
  - Auto config for Unix
      * cd into this projects folder
      * run at terminal "source ./Configure"
      * run at terminal "pytest phonebook_test.py"

  - if auto config fails (manual approach):
      * create a virtual environment
      * run at terminal 'make install' to install dependencies
      * run at terminal 'pytest phonebook_test.py' to run tests

  - More info:
      * command 'make freeze' updates requirements.text
